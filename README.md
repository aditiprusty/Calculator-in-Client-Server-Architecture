# Basic Calculator using Client-Server based Architecture
This is a client-server-based console application.
<br>
The application facilitates the seamless exchange of mathematical expressions between clients and a server. 
The core functionality of the calculator encompasses basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Clients connect to the server, input mathematical expressions, and receive real-time evaluations from the server. 
<br>
The primary goal is to create a system where users can intuitively input mathematical expressions via the console, and the server not only returns the results promptly but also maintains a record of each interaction.
